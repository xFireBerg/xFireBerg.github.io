<h3 style="text-align:center;">1. Bagh-e Babur</h3><br>
<img src="/Images/bagh-e-babur.jpg" alt="Bagh-e-Babur" align="left" style="margin:2%"> <br clear="right">


<p>The first Mughal emperor who ruled Kabul for many years and built ten gardens in the city had expressed a wish to be buried in one of them, which is famous today as Bagh e Babur. The Mughals, who reigned the Indian Subcontinent(1526 – 1858), built a magnificent empire based on well-founded and enduring institutions, laying the foundations of a dynastic rule which inaugurated one of the most glorious periods in the history of Islam. At their peak, the Mughals ruled over most of South Asia and parts of what is now Afghanistan.</p><br><br>

<p>The founder of the dynasty, Muhammad Zahir al-Din Babur (r. 1526-1530), gained control of Kabul, an important stopping place along the trade route between India and Central Asia, and from here he led his campaign to conquer the Indian subcontinent. Born in Ferghana in present-day Uzbekistan, where he is considered a national hero, Babur made inroads into this landlocked country in 1504 through Hindu Kush Mountains and captured Kabul. He died on January 5 1530 in Agra, and as per his wish, his body was moved to Kabul and buried in Bagh e Babur. </p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;">2. Darul Aman Palace</h3><br><br><br>
<img src="/Images/darulaman.jpg" alt="Bagh-e-Babur" align="left" width="800px" height="600px" style="margin:2%"> <br clear="right">
<p>Darul Aman, “the dwelling-place of peace,” sits in ruins outside Kabul, Afghanistan, a crumbling symbol of what was once supposed to be the modern future of the country. <br>
Amanullah Khan, ruler of Afghanistan between 1919 and 1929, ordered the construction of the impressive structure, intending the palace to be the centerpiece of a new capital city in the country.  The city was to be a gleaming, European-style settlement, rising up from the plains with the palace as the crown jewel. <br><br> Still standing today, Darul Aman is now a crumbling ruin. A plan to restore it has so far come to nothing but its walls still contain the last century of Afghan history: the grandeur of its ambitions, the depth of its bloodshed and violence, an ultimately a monument to the improbable resilience of hope. </p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;">3. Shah Do Shamshira Mosque</h3><br><br>
<img src="/Images/shahdoshamshira.jpg" alt="Bagh-e-Babur" align="left" width="800px" height="600px" style="margin:2%"> <br clear="right">
<p>The Shah-Do Shamshira Mosque, the “Mosque of the King of Two Swords”, is located in downtown Kabul along the edge of the Kabul River. It was built in the 1920s by Amanullah Khan (r. 1919-29), who attempted to introduce a number of modern reforms to Afghanistan. In an unusual design for a mosque, it features multiple levels and decorated with Italianate stucco, giving an effect that could be described as ‘Afghan Baroque’.</p> <br>
<p>The facades are all Italianate baroque with stucco detailing, picked out in white against a lurid lemon yellow paint-job. That it has two storeys is even more peculiar, and only the tiny minarets disclose the building's true purpose.</p><br>
