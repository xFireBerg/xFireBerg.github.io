<p> &emsp;&emsp;Welcome to my website. Since you are on this page, that means you would want to know a little more about me. I am Zabi. I come from Afghanistan, but was raised and schooled in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 
<br>I am currently pursuing my Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering at Anadolu University, Turkey. I speak six languages, up to varying degrees of fluencies, of course.</p>
<br>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;I like to enjoy myself watching TV shows or movies in my spare time. Also, am a reader before bedtime. Big fan of Agatha Christie novels. I like cubes, as in Rubik's cubes. I also take pleasure in having a cup of hot coffee, some light music, and a rush to code something. I have problems with procrastination, though. Like this assignment website which I had two weeks to make, but cruised through all the work on the last day. </p><br>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Anyway, as I was saying...I also play some chess, or I pretend to do, at least. Recently though, I have picked up Sudoku on a mobile app. Believe me or not, I never had played it before this...like all this time in my life I hadn't played Sudoku. Which is quite amazing, if you ask me. I mean both, the game and the fact that I went over 20 years in my life without having played Sudoku. <br>Also, I used to be quite big on online FPS games, ie. First Person Shooters, such as Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, Battlefield, etc, first on consoles, and then on PCs. I have been quite big on games ever since primary school actually. Had Atari, NES, Sega, PlayStation1 all through PlayStation4.</p><br>

<p> &emsp;&emsp;What I would really like to do, however, is to travel the world. Actually see the world. Meet people, make friends from all over, some enemies too, perhaps.<br> I mean what kind of a person travels the world and doesn't hit some nerves with a few randoms (also known as a NPCs, or non playable characters) here and there. Traveling makes you wise they say, I hope that is true. Else, I would just get bragging rights and no wisdom, which isn't a very humbling perspective. &emsp;&emsp;<br><br>That's it, if you would like to know more, just hit me up with an email from the contact page and I will get right back to you. Toodles!
